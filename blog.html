                <h2>My Undergraduate Personal Statement</h2>
                <p>A week or so I mentioned during a livestream that I’d share we you all my personal statement from
                    when I
                    applied to my undergraduate degree. I’ve already shared my statements from when I applied for my
                    Master’s
                    degree, which you can find here. I did a BA in Comparative Literature at King’s College London, …

                <h2>My Dissertation</h2>
                <p>By popular demand I have decided to share the dissertation I wrote for my BA (Hons) in Comparative
                    Literature. I made a 42 minute video on my channel about the last week of the process and have
                    mentioned
                    it
                    at various points though-out my last year, so audience curiosity is very understandable.</p>

                <p>As promised in a recent video, I’m sharing some mind maps of mine here on my blog to let you all have
                    a
                    better look at how I organised them. Hopefully this gives you a better impression of what to aim for
                    when
                    you’re writing your maps. But of course at the end of the …</p>

                <h2>The *Updated* Bookshhelf Tour // 2019</h2>
                <p>After very very very very many requests I finally did it: I finally made the
                    updated bookshelf tour. Back in June my pile of books on the floor rose from the ashes into the
                    beautiful Phoenix that is the new bookshelf. Am I thrilled with it? Yes. Yes I am. Has my little
                    library also …

                <p>oops, I mean I tried? I’m starting to be convinced that watching a film every
                    day for a month is an illusive and unobtainable goal that is going to take me prisoner for many
                    months until I just finally give in. If it becomes a challenge I really can’t help myself. So in the

                <p >I really did have every intention of watching a film every day in August, and
                    then the wifi didn’t work for two weeks. Streaming anything is still rather iffy. I got round to
                    watching 5 films in these 31 days. This is not fine film journalism, these are the thoughts I had,
                    they were not worth …

                <h2>Blog Reboot</h2>
                <p>A new blog? In this economic climate? I haven’t blogged since 2014. If we
                    don’t count tumblr of course, but we all know that wasn’t reeeeally blogging in the same sense. I
                    had one before because I wanted to be a fashion journalist. Do I laugh or cringe? Both. Both is
